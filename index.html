            <h2>About <span>Me</span></h2>
            <p>I'm Sujan Naidu Bhaskar Surisetty, a Master's student in Information Technology and Management at the University of Texas at Dallas. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Gitam University and have worked as a Data Engineer at Wipro, where I focused on data intake, ETL procedures, and real-time analytics. Python, SQL, HTML5, CSS3, and design software such as Figma and Adobe XD are among my specialties. I am certified in Python and Advanced SQL. I developed a user-friendly job matching platform that increased user engagement with responsive and visually appealing designs. In my real-time traffic pattern analysis project, I built a system that uses Hadoop and Spark ML-lib to improve network flow analysis and congestion prediction. In addition, I built a financial trend analysis bot using Python's NLTK package for sentiment analysis, which provided useful insights into market sentiment.</p>

                    <h2>Data Engineer</h2>
                    <p>As a Data Engineer at Wipro Private Limited, I was responsible for building and monitoring data ingestion procedures, which efficiently handled a daily input of 1 million events from diverse sources such as weblogs, user activities, sales transactions, and product catalog data. I made substantial contributions to the architecture of a scalable and distributed storage system on Amazon S3, guaranteeing that it could accommodate the project's expanding data volume. By creating ETL-based data processing and transformation pipelines, I increased data quality and consistency, resulting in the cleansing and enrichment of 95% of incoming data. My engagement with agile teams on data validation and migration projects utilizing Hadoop and Snowflake in a Python environment resulted in a 15% increase in output delivery efficiency. In addition, I participated in proactive issue monitoring, helping to resolve 90% of issues before they impacted project timetables. This time at Wipro helped me strengthen my abilities in data engineering, agile approaches, and cross-functional collaboration.</p>

                    <h2>Web Development</h2>
                    <p>I am a web developer with experience in both front-end and back-end technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React, Node.js), Ruby on Rails, and Python. I am proficient in SQL, NoSQL (MongoDB), and database design, as well as good UI/UX design skills with Adobe XD, Sketch, and Figma. My academic experience involves building responsive web applications, optimizing performance, and working with designers to improve user experiences. Notable projects include a Job Search Board platform, a personal portfolio website with dynamic animations, and a live chat application. I earned a Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering from Gitam University and am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Information Technology and Management at The University of Texas at Dallas.</p>

                <h5>Blockchain Data Ingestion and Analysis Using Hadoop Ecosystem</h5>
                <p>To collect real-time blockchain data, we designed and constructed a robust data intake pipeline using Apache Flume. Hadoop HDFS was deployed for efficient blockchain data storage, allowing for easy handling of enormous data volumes. Complex data transformations were performed with Apache Pig to improve blockchain data analysis capabilities. Optimized data processing operations resulted in better real-time insights and decision-making. Ensured high throughput and minimal latency while processing over 1 million blockchain transactions per day.</p>
